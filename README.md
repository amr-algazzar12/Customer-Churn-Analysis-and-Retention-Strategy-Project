# Customer Churn Analysis and Retention Strategy

##  Project Overview
This project analyzes customer behavior to predict **churn risk** (whether a customer will leave the service).  
The goal is to:
- Understand key factors that lead to churn.
- Build and evaluate machine learning models for churn prediction.
- Deploy the model with a simple interface.
- Provide data-driven **retention strategies** for businesses.

##  Objectives
1. Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify customer behavior patterns.
2. Preprocess the data: handle missing values, encode categorical features, and scale numeric features.
3. Train and evaluate **classification models** (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
4. Deploy a simple **prediction app** (Streamlit/Flask).
5. Summarize insights and propose **retention strategies**.
